# The author

![Henning Thies](images/henning-thies.jpg){:class="w-36"}

Hey, my name is Henning.

I am a freelance software engineer and consultant with a focus on Ruby on Rails applications. 
Over the past decade, I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from small websites to large enterprise applications. Including taking over a management position leading 2 developoment teams of up to 12 developers across europe.

Since the raise of AI and it's accessibility to the masses, I have been diving into the topic. This blog is a collection of me trying different things and sharing my experiences with you.

I hope you enjoy it!
